This project was our first using if, else, and while.
We also worked with int variables, char variables, putchar, and printf.
The programs include:

printing whether a random int is positive or negative

printing the last digit of a random number and information about its value

printing strings with printf and putchar

printing a string of digits

printing digits without putchar or char variables

printing non-repeating combinations of numbers using putchar
